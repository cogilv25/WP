# Getting Started
This project was developed with [node.js v22.12.0](https://nodejs.org/en), however, as of the time of writing it should work on any version newer than this. Once installed copy the game directory anywhere you want, open a terminal, change the current directory to the game directory, and run the command `npm install`. Once that has complete use the command `node main.js` to start the server. From a browser connect to the IP of the PC running the server on port 8000 (This will look something like `192.168.1.100:8000`), create an account, create a lobby, have a friend join you, and play!

# The Game
## Introduction
The game is a very early prototype, but the basic concept is that 2 players must climb a tower where both players have a hunger bar that slowly ticks down, with the game restarting if either player reaches 0 hunger. There are 3 distinct stages to hunger or rather satiation and these affect the stats of the player from speed and jump height, to special abilities, these stages are referred to by the name of the character that represents them for ease of understanding.

## Thin Man

## Medium Man

## Fat Man

## Conclusion
As you may be able to tease from these descriptions, the challenge of the game rests in the fact that the players need to consider how they will distribute food between themselves in order to solve the puzzles they encounter. On top of this the game would be fairly fine tuned so that hunger drops rapidly and therefore decisions have to be made in a matter of seconds allowing mental traps to be created as well as points of triumph for the player as they start to see into the mind of the creator and predicte these mental games.
