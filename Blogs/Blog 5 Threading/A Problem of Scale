# A Problem of Scale
When I was choosing the game I wanted to make for the multiplayer game assignment I was drawn to the idea of a puzzle based coperative game, the details of which are not relevant here, it is enough to know that the game is designed to be played by 2 players. Being as easily drawn in to the over complicated as I am, I thought it seemed a shame to only allow 2 players to play, and so why not allow multiple games to run on their own threads!

Node provides threading functionality through its [worker threads API](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) and is relatively easy to work with


# Main Problem Solution
{"update":[{"x":100,"y":100,"r":0.123},{"x":100,"y":100,"r":0.123},{"x":100,"y":100,"r":0.123},{"x":100,"y":100,"r":0.123}]}

124 characters = 124 bytes


37 bytes "update"
6*4 = 24

37+24 = 61
