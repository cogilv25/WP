Hello, I have included the blog as a pdf as it's the only way I could find to export it from Mahara, additionally when I tried to create a "secret url" to share it, for some reason it cuts the bottom of my blog posts off!

I made a video to accompany the 4th blog post and this is included in the submission, additionally it is on YouTube if that is preferable, I included the link in the post but it might be a pain to copy and paste from the pdf so I will put it here as well:
